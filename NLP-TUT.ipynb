    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will attempt to implement a recurrent neural network for text generation based on a text dataset from Shakespeare / Goethe. The tutorial has been inspired by the original [tensorflow tutorials](www.tensorflow.org) and Andrej Karpathies work and thus based on numpy only. \n",

    "## Core Idea \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will focus on a text generation approach based on a character-based RNN. We will work with a dataset similar to the dataset of Shakespeare's writing provided by Andrej Karpathy's and first used in his [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). Given a sequence of characters from this data (\"Mephist\"), train a model to predict the next character in the sequence (\"o\"). Longer sequences of text can be generated by calling the model repeatedly, or in other words recurrent.\n"
